# TIP: use 'str(23)' to convert number to string when needed.

# 1. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
# operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations
# in print statements to see the results. You should create four lines that look
# like this:
# print(5 + 3)
# Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.
print('1. ========================================================')
print(4 + 4)
print(12 - 4)
print(int(round(1.6 * 5)))
print(64 / 8)

print('2. ========================================================')

# 2. Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using
# that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that
# message
favorite_number = 14
print('My favorite number is: ' + str(favorite_number))
