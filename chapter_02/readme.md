## Chapter 2: Variables and simple data types

1.  _Simple messages_: Store a message in a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of your variable to a new message, and print the new message. [Solution](./1_simple_messages.py)
2.  _Personal Message_: Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a mes- sage to that person . Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”. [Solution](./2_personal_message.py)
3.  _Name Cases_: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that per- son’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase. [Solution](./3_name_cases.py)
4.  _Famous Quote_: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
    > Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”

[Solution](./4_famous_quote.py)

5.  _Famous Quote 2_: Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time store the famous per- son’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message. [Solution](./5_famous_quote_2.py)
6.  _Stripping Names_: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, `lstrip()`, `rstrip()`, and `strip()`. [Solution](./stripping_names.py)
7.  _Number Eight_: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results. You should create four lines that look
    like this: `print(5 + 3)`. Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line. [Solution](./7_number_eight.py)
8.  _Favorite Number_: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message. [Solution](./8_favorite_number.py)
