# Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table wonâ€™t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.
# â€¢ Start with your program from Exercise 3-6. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.
# â€¢ Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list.
# Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know youâ€™re sorry you canâ€™t invite them to dinner.
# â€¢ Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know theyâ€™re still invited.
# â€¢ Use del to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list.
# Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.
