# Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests canâ€™t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations.
# Youâ€™ll have to think of someone else to invite.
# â€¢ Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who canâ€™t make it.
# â€¢ Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who canâ€™t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
# â€¢ Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.
